   <h2 ><strong>Review</strong></h2>
   <P>In the late 1990s, Pushpa Raj, a laborer in Chittoor District, is denied a surname due to his illegitimate status. 
      Despite constant disrespect, he possesses a unique ability to smuggle red sandalwood. As he rises through the ranks of a smuggling syndicate, he makes powerful enemies.
      The film, directed by Sukumar, stars Allu Arjun as Pushpa Raj and features Fahadh Faasil, Rashmika Mandanna, and others in key roles.
      Released in 2021, it received mixed reviews but became a commercial success, grossing over ₹360–373 crore worldwide. </P>
